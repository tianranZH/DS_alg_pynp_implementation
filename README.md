# Data science algorithm implementation
 To brush up my knowledge of popular data science algs, and pick up my lost math mind after university, I set myself a goal to implement those algs in raw python+numpy/numba implementation.\
 The main purpose is to understand how those models work, any considerations during fitting, loss function choice, so that hopefully I can apply those knowledge in my day-to-day work.\
 Also wouldn't object any fun trying to improve the running speed by using numba :)\
 
 
## To do list:
- [x] Logistic Regression
- [ ] Linear Regression
- [ ] K-means
- [ ] KNN
- [ ] SVM
- [ ] Backpropagation NN
